Below is a complete list of fetchers and all other currently conceived modules for your Jarvis project. This list includes data-fetching components (fetchers) and supporting modules designed to enhance functionality, based on the project’s research-oriented goals. Each item includes its purpose and current development status.

---

### Fetchers (Data Sources)
Fetchers are modules designed to retrieve data from external sources, tailored to specific databases or APIs.

1. **ArXiv Fetcher** (`arxiv_fetcher.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves preprints from ArXiv, focusing on cutting-edge research in fields like computer science, physics, and mathematics.  
   - **Status**: Completed  

2. **PubMed Fetcher** (`pubmed_fetcher.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Fetches abstracts and metadata from PubMed, with optional full-text retrieval via PMC or Unpaywall, targeting biomedical and life sciences literature.  
   - **Status**: Completed  

3. **Semantic Scholar Fetcher** (`semantic_scholar_fetcher.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Obtains academic papers from Semantic Scholar, including metadata, abstracts, and citation data across various disciplines.  
   - **Status**: Completed  

4. **Web Search Fetcher**  
   - **Purpose**: Gathers web articles, blogs, or general content using a search API (e.g., Google Custom Search) to capture current trends and non-academic discussions.  
   - **Status**: built  

5. **Social Media Fetcher**  
   - **Purpose**: Collects posts or discussions from social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to provide real-time insights and community perspectives.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built  

6. **Other Academic Database Fetchers** (e.g., IEEE Xplore, Springer, Google Scholar)  
   - **Purpose**: Expands coverage to additional paid or niche academic databases, potentially requiring extra setup or paid APIs.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built (optional, low priority)

### Supporting Modules
These modules handle tasks like query processing, data analysis, and user interaction to complement the fetchers and create a cohesive system.

1. **Query Processor** (`query_processor.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Refines and expands user queries using techniques such as synonym expansion (e.g., via WordNet) or potentially LLM-based methods.  
   - **Status**: Partially built (needs further development for advanced refinement)  

2. **Memory Module** (`memory.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Tracks conversational memory and project context, storing past queries and results to improve future searches.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built  

3. **Data Analyzer** (`data_analyzer.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes fetched data to identify trends, emerging topics, and citation networks, aiding in finding influential papers or new research directions.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built  

4. **Data Processor** (`data_processor.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Processes retrieved data with features like automated summarization and language translation for better accessibility.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built  

5. **RAG CLI** (`rag_cli.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction, including query input, feedback, and result display.  
   - **Status**: Partially built (in progress)  

6. **Logger** (`logger.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Implements centralized logging for the entire application, ensuring consistent tracking of events and errors.  
   - **Status**: Completed and integrated  

7. **Settings** (`settings.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: Loads and validates configuration settings from a `.env` file, including API keys and other constants.  
   - **Status**: Completed and integrated

### Additional Potential Modules
These optional modules could further enhance the system’s capabilities if needed.

1. **Full-Text Fetcher** (`full_text_fetcher.py`)  
   - **Purpose**: A reusable module to fetch full-text PDFs or XMLs using services like Unpaywall or PMC, reducing redundancy across fetchers.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built (suggested for future refactoring)  

2. **Multi-Modal Fetcher**  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves non-text content such as images or videos, useful if research requires diverse media types.  
   - **Status**: Not yet built (low priority unless required)
