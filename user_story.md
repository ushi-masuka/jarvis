# User Story: Using Jarvis as a Research Assistant

## 1. Starting a New Project
As a user, I want to create a new research project workspace (e.g., “AI in Chemistry”), so that all my data, memory, and expert models are kept separate for each topic.
- I launch Jarvis and select “Create New Project.”
- I give the project a name and a short description of my research goal.
- Jarvis sets up a new workspace with isolated memory, configuration, and (optionally) a dedicated model.

## 2. Defining My Research Focus
As a user, I want to specify my research questions or areas of interest, so Jarvis can focus its efforts.
- I enter a research question or keywords (e.g., “What are the latest trends in AI-driven drug discovery?”).
- Jarvis confirms my input and asks clarifying questions if needed.

## 3. Automated Knowledge Acquisition
As a user, I want Jarvis to autonomously gather relevant information from a wide range of sources.
- Jarvis fetches research papers, books, articles, blogs, and media from sources like arXiv, PubMed, Semantic Scholar, Google Books, Wikipedia, and more.
- Jarvis can fetch both text and media (PDFs, HTML, videos, transcripts, images).
- Jarvis respects access policies (robots.txt, paywalls) and logs all sources.

## 4. Data Ingestion and Understanding
As a user, I want Jarvis to process and deeply understand the collected information.
- Jarvis cleans and chunks the data, then embeds it into a vector database or knowledge graph for efficient retrieval.
- Jarvis tags and summarizes each chunk, building a rich, searchable knowledge base unique to my project.

## 5. Multi-Expert Reasoning
As a user, I want to ask complex questions and get expert-level, well-reasoned answers.
- I type (or speak) a question.
- Jarvis routes the query to the most relevant expert agent (e.g., a chemistry expert, a machine learning expert).
- Jarvis retrieves supporting evidence from its knowledge base and generates a grounded, multi-step answer.
- Jarvis can compare, analyze, or synthesize information across sources and subfields.

## 6. Teaching and Explanation
As a user, I want Jarvis to teach me about complex topics in ways I understand.
- Jarvis can explain concepts step-by-step, using analogies, diagrams (ASCII/Mermaid), flashcards, quizzes, and cheat sheets.
- I can ask Jarvis to summarize, explain, or “teach” any retrieved content.
- Jarvis can read answers aloud using text-to-speech.

## 7. Trend Analysis and Problem Discovery
As a user, I want Jarvis to help me discover trends, research gaps, and possible problem statements.
- Jarvis analyzes the literature for emerging topics, consensus/disagreement, and research gaps.
- Jarvis suggests possible problem statements or research directions based on current trends.

## 8. Interactive and Accessible UI
As a user, I want to interact with Jarvis through both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
- The CLI supports rich markdown output, color-coded responses, and command flags (e.g., --explain, --summarize, --tts).
- The GUI (future) allows uploading files, chatting, viewing memory, and controlling audio.

## 9. Project Memory and Personalization
As a user, I want Jarvis to remember my past queries, preferences, and feedback within each project.
- Jarvis keeps a project-specific memory of all interactions, sources, and user feedback.
- Jarvis personalizes its responses and suggestions based on my history.

## 10. Security and Extensibility
As a user, I want my data and API keys to remain secure, and I want the ability to add new data sources or experts as my needs evolve.
- Jarvis stores all secrets securely and never exposes them in logs or code.
- I (or future contributors) can add new fetchers, experts, or analysis modules with minimal changes.

---

Jarvis is my personal research assistant that autonomously gathers, processes, and reasons over vast knowledge, helps me learn, suggests new research directions, and adapts to my needs—all within secure, isolated project workspaces.
